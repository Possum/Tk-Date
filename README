Tk::Date Module

Tk::Date is a date widget in development. See demos/date.pl or the
examples subdirectory for usage examples.

The pod is still rudimentary, but there are at least all options listed.
Note that tied variables don't work very well.

To install, type

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make install

Additional requirements (it's not essential, but recommended):
Tk-GBARR-1.03.tar.gz or better. For full functionality of the "get"
method, either the POSIX or Date::Format module is also needed.

After installation, you may start the "widget" program to invoke the
Tk::Date demonstration (it's in the "User Contributed Demonstrations"
section). The demo is also startable with "make demo" before
installation.
